in electrical engineering a capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy by accumulating electric charges on two closely spaced surfaces that are insulated from each other the capacitor was originally known as the condenser a term still encountered in a few compound names such as the condenser microphone it is a passive electronic component with two terminals the utility of a capacitor depends on its capacitance while some capacitance exists between any two electrical conductors in proximity in a circuit a capacitor is a component designed specifically to add capacitance to some part of the circuit the physical form and construction of practical capacitors vary widely and many types of capacitor are in common use most capacitors contain at least two electrical conductors often in the form of metallic plates or surfaces separated by a dielectric medium a conductor may be a foil thin film sintered bead of metal or an electrolyte the nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity materials commonly used as dielectrics include glass ceramic plastic film paper mica air and oxide layers when an electric potential difference is applied across the terminals of a capacitor for example when a capacitor is connected across a battery an electric field develops across the dielectric causing a net positive charge to collect on one plate and net negative charge to collect on the other plate no current actually flows through a perfect dielectric however there is a flow of charge through the source circuit if the condition is maintained sufficiently long the current through the source circuit ceases if a time-varying voltage is applied across the leads of the capacitor the source experiences an ongoing current due to the charging and discharging cycles of the capacitor capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices unlike a resistor an ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy although real-life capacitors do dissipate a small amount
