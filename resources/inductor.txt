an inductor also called a coil choke or reactor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when an electric current flows through it an inductor typically consists of an insulated wire wound into a coil when the current flowing through the coil changes the time-varying magnetic field induces an electromotive force in the conductor described by Faraday's law of induction according to Lenz's law the induced voltage has a polarity which opposes the change in current that created it as a result inductors oppose any changes in current through them an inductor is characterized by its inductance which is the ratio of the voltage to the rate of change of current in the International system of units SI the unit of inductance is the henry H named for 19th century american scientist Joseph Henry in the measurement of magnetic circuits it is equivalent to weber/ampere⁠ inductors have values that typically range from 1 μH to 20 H many inductors have a magnetic core made of iron or ferrite inside the coil which serves to increase the magnetic field and thus the inductance along with capacitors and resistors inductors are one of the three passive linear circuit elements that make up electronic circuits inductors are widely used in alternating current AC electronic equipment particularly in radio equipment they are used to block AC while allowing DC to pass inductors designed for this purpose are called chokes they are also used in electronic filters to separate signals of different frequencies and in combination with capacitors to make tuned circuits used to tune radio and TV receivers
