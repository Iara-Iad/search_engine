a resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element in electronic circuits resistors are used to reduce current flow adjust signal levels to divide voltages bias active elements and terminate transmission lines among other uses high-power resistors that can dissipate many watts of electrical power as heat may be used as part of motor controls in power distribution systems or as test loads for generators fixed resistors have resistances that only change slightly with temperature time or operating voltage variable resistors can be used to adjust circuit elements such as a volume control or a lamp dimmer or as sensing devices for heat light humidity force or chemical activity resistors are common elements of electrical networks and electronic circuits and are ubiquitous in electronic equipment practical resistors as discrete components can be composed of various compounds and forms resistors are also implemented within integrated circuits the electrical function of a resistor is specified by its resistance common commercial resistors are manufactured over a range of more than nine orders of magnitude the nominal value of the resistance falls within the manufacturing tolerance indicated on the component
